# Repaint

### Try out by running the application: [ðŸ”— Download Repaint.exe (Windows) ðŸ“¥](https://github.com/abhi5658/repaint/raw/master/Repaint.exe)
> After clicking on downlaod it might say that the file "*...is not commonly downloaded and may be dangerous*". Since this was locally generated .exe file and I didnt knew how to add a publisher to executable, the system shows the file as dangerous. All in all the risk is yours and would stay as it is.
